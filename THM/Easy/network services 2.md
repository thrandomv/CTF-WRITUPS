**What does NFS stand for?**  
`Network File System`

**What process allows an NFS client to interact with a remote directory as though it was a physical device?**  
`Mounting`

**What does NFS use to represent files and directories on the server?**  
`file handle`

**What protocol does NFS use to communicate between the server and client?**  
`RPC`

**What two pieces of user data does the NFS server take as parameters for controlling user permissions? Format: parameter 1 / parameter 2**  
`user id / group id`

**Can a Windows NFS server share files with a Linux client? (Y/N)**  
`Y`

**Can a Linux NFS server share files with a MacOS client? (Y/N)**  
`Y`

**What is the latest version of NFS? [released in 2016, but is still up to date as of 2020] This will require external research.**  
`4.2`

**Conduct a thorough port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?**  
`7`

**Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?**  
`2049`

**Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?**  
`/home`

**Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?**  
`cappucino`

**Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folders could contain keys that would give us remote access to the server?**  
`.ssh`

**Which of these keys is most useful to us?**  
`id_rsa`

**Can we log into the machine using ssh -i <key-file> <username>@<ip> ? (Y/N)**  
`Y`

**Now, we're going to add the SUID bit permission to the bash executable we just copied to the share using "sudo chmod +[permission] bash". What letter do we use to set the SUID bit set using chmod?**  
`s`

**Let's do a sanity check, let's check the permissions of the "bash" executable using "ls -la bash". What does the permission set look like? Make sure that it ends with -sr-x.**  
`-rwsr-sr-x`

**Great! If all's gone well you should have a shell as root! What's the root flag?**  
`THM{nfs_got_pwned}`

**What does SMTP stand for?**  
`Simple Mail Transfer Protocol`

**What does SMTP handle the sending of? (answer in plural)**  
`emails`

**What is the first step in the SMTP process?**  
`SMTP handshake`

**What is the default SMTP port?**  
`25`

**Where does the SMTP server send the email if the recipient's server is not available?**  
`smtp queue`

**On what server does the Email ultimately end up on?**  
`POP/IMAP`

**Can a Linux machine run an SMTP server? (Y/N)**  
`Y`

**Can a Windows machine run an SMTP server? (Y/N)**  
`Y`

**First, lets run a port scan against the target machine, same as last time. What port is SMTP running on?**  
`25`

**Okay, now we know what port we should be targeting, let's start up Metasploit. What command do we use to do this?**  
`msfconsole`

**Let's search for the module "smtp_version", what's it's full module name?**  
`auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version`

**Great, now- select the module and list the options. How do we do this?**  
`options`

**Have a look through the options, does everything seem correct? What is the option we need to set?**  
`RHOSTS`

**Set that to the correct value for your target machine. Then run the exploit. What's the system mail name?**  
`polosmtp.home`

**What Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) is running the SMTP server? This will require some external research.**  
`Postfix`

**Good! We've now got a good amount of information on the target system to move onto the next stage. Let's search for the module "smtp_enum", what's it's full module name?**  
`auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum`

**What option do we need to set to the wordlist's path?**  
`USER_FILE`

**Once we've set this option, what is the other essential paramater we need to set?**  
`RHOSTS`

**Okay! Now that's finished, what username is returned?**  
`administrator`

**What is the password of the user we found during our enumeration stage?**  
`alejandro`

**Great! Now, let's SSH into the server as the user, what is contents of smtp.txt**  
`THM{who_knew_email_servers_were_c00l?}`

**What type of software is MySQL?**  
`relational database management system`

**What language is MySQL based on?**  
`SQL`

**What communication model does MySQL use?**  
`client-server`

**What is a common application of MySQL?**  
`back end database`

**What major social network uses MySQL as their back-end database? This will require further research.**  
`Facebook`

**As always, let's start out with a port scan, so we know what port the service we're trying to attack is running on. What port is MySQL using?**  
`3306`

**Search for, select and list the options it needs. What three options do we need to set? (in descending order).**  
`PASSWORD/RHOSTS/USERNAME`

**Run the exploit. By default it will test with the "select version()" command, what result does this give you?**  
`5.7.29-0ubuntu0.18.04.1`

**Great! We know that our exploit is landing as planned. Let's try to gain some more ambitious information. Change the "sql" option to "show databases". how many databases are returned?**  
`4`

**First, let's search for and select the "mysql_schemadump" module. What's the module's full name?**  
`auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_schemadump`

**Great! Now, you've done this a few times by now so I'll let you take it from here. Set the relevant options, run the exploit. What's the name of the last table that gets dumped?**  
`x$waits_global_by_latency`

**Awesome, you have now dumped the tables, and column names of the whole database. But we can do one better... search for and select the "mysql_hashdump" module. What's the module's full name?**  
`auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_hashdump`

**Again, I'll let you take it from here. Set the relevant options, run the exploit. What non-default user stands out to you?**  
`carl`

**What is the user/hash combination string?**  
`carl:*EA031893AA21444B170FC2162A56978B8CEECE18`

**Now, we need to crack the password! Let's try John the Ripper against it using: "john hash.txt" what is the password of the user we found?**  
`doggie`

**Awesome. Password reuse is not only extremely dangerous, but extremely common. What are the chances that this user has reused their password for a different service?**  
`THM{congratulations_you_got_the_mySQL_flag}`
