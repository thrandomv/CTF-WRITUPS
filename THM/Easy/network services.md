`response-request`

**What do clients connect to servers using?**  
`TCP/IP`

**What systems does Samba run on?**  
`Unix`

**Conduct an nmap scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?**  
`3`

**What ports is SMB running on?**  
`139/445`

**Let's get started with Enum4Linux, conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the workgroup name?**  
`WORKGROUP`

**What comes up as the name of the machine?**  
`POLOSMB`

**What operating system version is running?**  
`6.1`

**What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?**  
`profiles`

**What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?**  
`smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445`

**Does the share allow anonymous access? Y/N?**  
`Y`

**Great! Have a look around for any interesting documents that could contain valuable information. Who can we assume this profile folder belongs to?**  
`John Cactus`

**What service has been configured to allow him to work from home?**  
`ssh`

**Okay! Now we know this, what directory on the share should we look in?**  
`.ssh`

`ssh`

**How would you connect to a Telnet server with the IP 10.10.10.3 on port 23?**  
`telnet 10.10.10.3 23`

**The lack of what, means that all Telnet communication is in plaintext?**  
`encryption`

**How many ports are open on the target machine?**  
`1`

**What port is this?**  
`8012`

**This port is unassigned, but still lists the protocol it's using, what protocol is this?**  
`tcp`

**Now re-run the nmap scan, without the -p- tag, how many ports show up as open?**  
`0`

**Based on the title returned to us, what do we think this port could be used for?**  
`a backdoor`

**Who could it belong to? Gathering possible usernames is an important step in enumeration.**  
`Skidy`

**Great! It's an open telnet connection! What welcome message do we receive?**  
`SKIDY'S BACKDOOR.`

**Let's try executing some commands, do we get a return on any input we enter into the telnet session? (Y/N)**  
`N`

**Now, use the command "ping [local THM ip] -c 1" through the telnet session to see if we're able to execute system commands. Do we receive any pings? Note, you need to preface this with .RUN (Y/N)**  
`Y`

**What word does the generated payload start with?**  
`mkfifo`

**What would the command look like for the listening port we selected in our payload?**  
`nc -lvnp 4444`
