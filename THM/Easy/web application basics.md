**Which component on a computer is responsible for hosting and delivering content for web applications?**  
`web server`

**Which tool is used to access and interact with web applications?**  
`web browser`

**Which component acts as a protective layer, filtering incoming traffic to block malicious attacks, and ensuring the security of the the web application?**  
`web application firewall`

**Which protocol provides encrypted communication to ensure secure data transmission between a web browser and a web server?**  
`HTTPS`

**What term describes the practice of registering domain names that are misspelt variations of popular websites to exploit user errors and potentially engage in fraudulent activities?**  
`Typosquatting`

**What part of a URL is used to pass additional information, such as search terms or form inputs, to the web server?**  
`Query String`

**Which HTTP message is returned by the web server after processing a client's request?**  
`HTTP response`

**What follows the headers in an HTTP message?**  
`Empty Line`

**Which HTTP protocol version became widely adopted and remains the most commonly used version for web communication, known for introducing features like persistent connections and chunked transfer encoding?**  
`HTTP/1.1`

**Which HTTP request method describes the communication options for the target resource, allowing clients to determine which HTTP methods are supported by the web server?**  
`OPTIONS`

**In an HTTP request, which component specifies the specific resource or endpoint on the web server that the client is requesting, typically appearing after the domain name in the URL?**  
`URL Path`

**Which HTTP request header specifies the domain name of the web server to which the request is being sent?**  
`Host`

**What is the default content type for form submissions in an HTTP request where the data is encoded as key=value pairs in a query string format?**  
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

**Which part of an HTTP request contains additional information like host, user agent, and content type, guiding how the web server should process the request?**

`Server Error Responses`

**Which HTTP status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the web server?**  
`404`

**Which HTTP response header can reveal information about the web server's software and version, potentially exposing it to security risks if not removed?**  
`Server`

**Which flag should be added to cookies in the Set-Cookie HTTP response header to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS, protecting them from being exposed during unencrypted transmissions?**  
`Secure`

**Which flag should be added to cookies in the Set-Cookie HTTP response header to prevent them from being accessed via JavaScript, thereby enhancing security against XSS attacks?**  
`HttpOnly`

**In a Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration, which property can be set to define where scripts can be loaded from?**  
`script-src`

**When configuring the Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header to ensure that all subdomains of a site also use HTTPS, which directive should be included to apply the security policy to both the main domain and its subdomains?**  
`includeSubDomains`

**Which HTTP header directive is used to prevent browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than what is specified by the server, thereby mitigating content type sniffing attacks?**  
`nosniff`
