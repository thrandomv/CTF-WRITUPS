**Terraform Core takes its input from two sources; this source keeps track of what the infrastructure currently looks like. What is the name of this source?**  
`State`

**The other source defines what you want infrastructure to look like. What is the name of this source?**  
`Terraform Config files`

**If there is a difference between what the infrastructure currently looks like and what you want it to look like, this will require a change. This change will be actioned by a....?**  
`Provider`

**When defining the VPC (in the first example) before the resource block, what was defined?**  
`provider`

**When modulating your infrastructure, what file acts as the central configuration file?**  
`main.tf`

**Instead of repeatedly defining values across multiple infrastructure modules these values can be collected in one file and referenced. What is the name of this file?**  
`variables.tf`

**What command would you run to action the steps outlined to take your infrastructure from the desired state to the actual state?**  
`terraform apply`

**What command would you run to prepare your workspace?**  
`terraform init`

**What command, when run, would provide you with a series of actions that would be required to take your infrastructure from the desired state to the actual state?**  
`terraform plan`

**What is generated during stack creation?**  
`events`

**Can you define rollback triggers in a template? (yay or nay)**  
`yay`

**What allows you to refer to resources in another stack?**  
`Cross-Stack References`

**Does CloudFormation support intrinsic functions? (yay or nay)**  
`yay`

**What feature helps you understand the impact of modifications before they are applied?**  
`change sets`

**Is CloudFormation cloud agnostic? (yay or nay)**  
`nay`

**Which IaC tool has deep AWS integration?**  
`CloudFormation`

**Which IaC tool has accessible community-driven modules?**  
`Terraform`

**What can you do instead of hardcoding secrets in IaC code?**  
`Parameterise Sensitive Data`

**What collaborative process can catch security issues early?**  
`Code Reviews`

**What policies can you implement in CloudFormation for update controls?**  
`Stack Policies`

**Can you use your Cloud-based IaC knowledge to get the flag?**
