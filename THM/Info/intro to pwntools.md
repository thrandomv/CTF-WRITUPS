`JJJJ`

**What is the output of "cyclic 12"?**  
`aaaabaaacaaa`

**What pattern, in hex, was the eip overflowed with?**  
`0x6161616a`

**What is the flag?**  
`flag{13@rning_2_pwn!}`

**What port is serving our challenge?**  
`1337`

**Please use checksec on serve_test. Is there a stack canary? (Y or N)**  
`Y`

`Trace/breakpoint trap`

**Run the command "shellcraft i386.linux.sh -f a", which will print our shellcode in assembly format. The first line will tell you that it is running a function from the Unix standard library, with the parameters of "(path='/bin///sh', argv=['sh'], envp=0)." What function is it using?**
