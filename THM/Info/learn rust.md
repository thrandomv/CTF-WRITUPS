`E0308`

**Does the code in question 2 compile? T(rue) or F(alse)**  
`F`

**What is the error message returned?**

**How do we define a constant in Rust?**  
`const`

**Can we shadow a constant? T(rue) or F(alse)**  
`F`

**What do we use to change the type of an immutable variable once it has been defined?**  
`shadowed`

`let mut tryhackme: u32 = 9;`

**What data type is used to represent a string slice?**  
`&str`

**Let's say you had a variable, X. You wanted to typehint the variable as a string. What would you write? Include X in the variable but not the let or = parts.**  
`x: String`

**Will question 1 return 8172192? T(rue) or F(alse)**  
`F`

**Will example 2 run? T(rue) or F(alse)**

`F`

**Every function need to return something. T(rue) or F(alse)**  
`F`

**Functions in Rust can be nested within other functions. T(rue) or F(alse)**  
`T`

**What keyword do we use to return early from a function?**  
`return`

**You nest a function named main, inside another function named main. Will this run? T(rue) or F(alse)**  
`T`

**How do we break out of a loop?**  
`break`

**Simplest keyword to make an infinite loop?**  
`loop`

**Turn let a = [10, 20]; into something we can iterate over.**  
`a.iter()`

**While loops can also be infinite. T(rue) or F(alse).**  
`T`

**Iterators are lazy. T(rue) or F(alse).**  
`T`

**For loops are explicitly mentioned in the Rust book as zero cost abstractions. T(rue) or F(alse).**  
`F`

**Zero Cost Abstractions are common in high level languages like Python or JavaScript T(rue) or F(alse).**  
`F`

**What crate do we use to easily make an iter multi threaded?**  
`Rayon`

**How do we tell Rust to include an external crate into our program? What file do we place this information in?**  
`cargo.toml`

**Turn a.iter() into a multi threaded parallel iter using Rayon**  
`a.par_iter()`

**What website do we go to for Crates?**  
`crates.io`

**We can assign variables based on an if statement on one line T(rue) or F(alse)**  
`T`

**What is the data type returned from opening a file?**  
`Result`

**Write the datatype of a generic Result with type hints**  
`Result T, E>`

**We're in a function and we get given a Result enum. If the Result is okay we want to continue working on it in this function. If the result is Err we want to return to the parent function with Err. What should we use?**  
`?`

**We're certain our result will always return Ok, what should we use?**  
`unwrap`

**Challenge 1**
